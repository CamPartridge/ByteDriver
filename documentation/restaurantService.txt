********** ENDPOINT INFORMATION **********
- Can only get ID parameter from the database
    - Essentially locks user from ever having access to it (May want to change so restaurant owners can have access to it)
- Can only add one restaurant at a time
- Some endpoints only work with .dict() even if it is deprecated - if not working change to .model_dump()
